If we have not yet had the opportunity to connect, this "Readme" can serve as a basic introduction to how I operate.  I look forward to connecting with you.

## Professional Values

My perspectives are continually evolving as I come across new experiences and new data.  That said, I have consistently come to value the following (style inspired by the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)):
* __Unique journeys__ over standard patterns of execution
* __The right questions__ over the right answers
* __Data__ over theory
* __Lean communication__ over thorough communication
* __Focus and fit__ over breadth
* __Evolutionary systems__ over up-front systems design

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, I have come to value the items on the left more.

## How I Contribute

{{< contributing-item src="/images/readme/ninja.svg" caption="Not a ninja" class="name" >}}
{{< contributing-item src="/images/readme/engineer.svg" caption="An engineer" class="name" >}}
{{< contributing-container type="end" >}}

I'm not a "rockstar" or a "ninja".  Rather, I operate at my best when I'm part of a larger value creation network, where trust and autonomy enable exceptional outcomes.  I love working with creative, diverse teams and appreciate detailed critiques of anything I'm doing.

## Where I Operate

I'm energized by travel for both work and leisure.  I particularly enjoy coming across new perspectives, experiences, and stories.  I've had the pleasure of working onsite with organizations in these places:

I'm currently based in New York City and have lived in the United States (the Rocky Mountains and Northeast regions) and Germany (Berlin).

## Interests and Proficiencies

I'm most interested and proficient in these areas:

## Technologies

My "core toolset" naturally changes over time.  In my current projects, I find the following to be exceptionally valuable:
